In this machine learning project, I used machine learning to predict employee churn from Kaggle's IBM HR dataset.
I did the whole project in tidymodels, which is a low-level ML framework in R.
I chose it, because it allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of the models I was building.

The project taught me:
* exploratory data analysis for machine learning
* handling class imbalance with subsampling
* pre-processing and modelling mixed feature types (i.e. datasets with categorical, ordinal, and numerical features)
* how to create an ensamble model from scratch
* how to tune hyperparameters based on different metrics (Youden's J, ROC AUC)

I hope you enjoy my scripts, and please let me know, if you have any feedback.
